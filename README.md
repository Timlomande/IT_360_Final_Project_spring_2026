  ## Project idea
  
  
This project involves creating a Windows-based digital forensics tool using PowerShell that focuses on tracking and reconstructing the activity of removable media devices such as USB drives. When a USB device is connected to a system, the tool will collect relevant forensic artifacts from the Windows registry and event logs to identify when the device was connected, how long it remained in use, and what system interactions occurred during that time. These artifacts will be correlated into a timeline, allowing investigators to clearly see USB-related activity on the machine. The tool is designed to operate in a read-only manner to preserve forensic integrity and minimize system impact. Its goal is to simplify USB usage analysis for investigations involving data exfiltration, policy violations, or unauthorized device use.
